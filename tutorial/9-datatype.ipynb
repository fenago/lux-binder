    "In Lux, data types convey the high-level, semantic roles for each attribute, such as whether it is temporal, nominal, or quantitative. The detected data type information are then used to infer the appropriate types of visualization to display for each attribute. Note that data types in Lux are different from the [dtype](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/basics.html#basics-dtypes) in Pandas, which involve atomic types such as string, integer, and float. Lux automatically infers the data type information for each column in the dataframe. The following code snippet shows what data types were inferred:\n",
